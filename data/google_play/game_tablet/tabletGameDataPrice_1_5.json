    "about": "Kingdom Eighties is a standalone expansion to the award-winning Kingdom series: A singleplayer adventure of micro-strategy and base building, inspired by the neon lights of the eighties.\n\nYou play as The Leader, a young camp counselor who will have to defend their town and family from the relentless attack of the mysterious Greed. What are these monsters, and why are they trying to steal their family legacy, the Crown of Creation?\n\nRecruit the neighborhood kids and assign them roles as soldiers or builders. Use coins to build and expand your kingdom, and fortify it by raising walls and defensive turrets. And be prepared for when the night comes, for the Greed will attack you without mercy. If you lose your crown, everything is doomed!\n\nEvery game in the Kingdom series holds secrets. Explore the surroundings to unlock mounts, discover technology upgrades and weapons, and learn how to manage your resources wisely to survive.\n\nA KINGDOM GAME FOR VETERANS AND NEWCOMERS\n\nBuilding upon the well-known mechanics from the previous Kingdom games, Kingdom Eighties will deep dive into the lore and worldbuilding of the series. And if you\u0027re new to it, the story elements will fluently guide you through the gameplay mechanics.\n\nMEET YOUR COMPANIONS\n\nYou will meet three supporting characters along the way: The Champ, The Tinkerer, and The Wiz. Each one has different abilities that you can combine to solve puzzles and find the solution to each level.\n\nHIT THE STREETS IN STYLE\n\nThe summer camp is just the beginning! You will travel through different locations never seen before in the Kingdom series. Find some fresh wheels at the skateboard park, visit the shops on Main Street, and free the New Lands Mall from the Greed.\n\nPIXEL ART MEETS SYNTH\n\nKingdom\u0027s iconic, handcrafted art style is back, now with a neon touch coming directly from the eighties aesthetics. Chill and vibe with the synthwave OST from Andreas Hald, and travel back to the wonder days of bike riding and summer camps, when everything seemed possible.",

    "about": "Gris is a hopeful young girl lost in her own world, dealing with a painful experience in her life. Her journey through sorrow is manifested in her dress, which grants new abilities to better navigate her faded reality. As the story unfolds, Gris will grow emotionally and see her world in a different way, revealing new paths to explore using her new abilities.\n\nGRIS is a serene and evocative experience, free of danger, frustration or death. Players will explore a meticulously designed world brought to life with delicate art, detailed animation, and an elegant original score. Through the game light puzzles, platforming sequences, and optional skill-based challenges will reveal themselves as more of Gris’s world becomes accessible.\n\nGRIS is an experience with almost no text, only simple control reminders illustrated through universal icons. The game can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their spoken language.",
