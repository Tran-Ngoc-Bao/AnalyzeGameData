Through face-to-face communication with Franz, visual novel gameplay and phone notifications, you can find out who she really is and what she truly desires.

It is up to you whether to submit to Franz or resist her manipulations as you go through the scary visual novel.\n\n\nFranz can kick you out of the app and lock you out of it for a certain period of time. You can choose whether to wait until Franz lets you back into the game or be the one who makes the choices of your own.

Depending on how quickly you open the app after receiving the notification, Franz will either be offended or delighted.\n\n\nFranz is a living entity that reacts differently to every action of yours, whether it\u0027s touching her, solving puzzles, ignoring her desires, or indulging her emotional manipulations. Therefore, depending on your behavior and choices, this scary interactive story will change.\n\nPlunge into the scary interactive story game about a choice between tenderness and severity.
